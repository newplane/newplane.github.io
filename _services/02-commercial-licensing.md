Open5GS operates under a dual licensing model, catering to the needs of both commercial and open-source projects.

The commercial [Open5GS](https://open5gs.org) license grants you complete rights to develop and distribute your software with no open-source license obligations. By opting for a commercial license, you can leverage Open5GS to its fullest potential while establishing a strategic partnership with [NewPlane](https://newplane.io).

For those who prefer open-source, Open5GS is also available under the [AGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt) license. This open-source licensing option is ideal for projects such as open-source distributions, academic research, hobbyist endeavors, internal research without external distribution, or any project where all AGPL-3.0 requirements are met.

If your legal team has concerns about the use of AGPL-licensed software, a commercial license may be a better fit. For more details on commercial licensing, please contact us at [\<sales@newplane.io\>](mailto:sales@newplane.io).
